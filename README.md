## setup 

1. Checkout this project

    * I ran into some package dependency issues that weren't easily fixed
3. Run dexalot.ipynb
    * This will prompt you for your [Meta Mask wallent and secret key](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-Export-an-Account-Private-Key).
4. You will need to deposit at least one token for AVAX and Team3 into your protfolio. There is a checkbox when you make the first desposit to approve all future requests. Make sure that is checked.
